# AutoLoadLastWorld
Make Minecraft auto load last world without any touch. Hold one of shift/alt/ctrl key to prevent loading, when access the main menu (The GUI with MINECRAFT title, Singleplayer, Multiplayer, Quit Game buttons).



The mechanic of this mod: Whenever the game is going to show the main menu (The GUI with MINECRAFT title, Singleplayer, Multiplayer, Quit Game buttons), load last world immediately if shift/alt/ctrl keys are not pressed.

e.g. You only need to hold one of shift/alt/ctrl key when clicking the "Save and Quit to Title" button. After you see the main menu, it's okay to release the key.



This is originally for making another mod, when I found it's annoy to run client and manually enter a world to debug my mod. With this mod, just hit run client and continue debugging in last world.



Might be helpful for the player who needs to load one world frequently.
